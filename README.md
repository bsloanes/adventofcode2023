>> Each day's folder consists of (a) a Jupyter notebook and (b) the text file(s) of that day's prompts
>> Once downloaded, open a new jupyter notebook or jupyter lab session through your command line
>> Each notebook contains a separate block of code that calculates phase I and phase II of that day's prompt. Run each individually to solve each day's phases.
